# Usehooks.ts

This is the repository for [usehooks.ts](https://usehooks.ts), a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) powered blog that publishes easy to understand React Hook code snippets.

UseHooks.ts has been strongly inspired by [usehooks.com](https://usehooks.com), thanks to him. My objective here is to publish my hooks in Typescript in order to find them quickly

If you'd like to submit new post ideas, improve existing posts, or change anything about the website feel free to submit an issue or pull-request.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000).
