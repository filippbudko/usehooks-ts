This React Hook offers you an interface to toggle and read the dark theme mode between three values.

The returned value `isDarkMode` is a boolean to let you be able to use with your logic.
The returned value `ternaryModeCode` is a enum of string of type `"dark" | "system" | "light"`.
When `ternaryModeCode` is set to `system`, the `isDarkMode` will use system theme, like in iOS and MacOS.

It uses internally [`useLocalStorage()`](/react-hook/use-local-storage) to persist the value and listens the OS color scheme preferences.
