This React Hook offers you an interface to toggle and read the dark theme mode between three values.
The returned value (`isDarkMode`) is a boolean to let you be able to use with your logic.
The auxiliary returned value (`ternaryModeCode`) is a enum of string of type `"dark" | "system" | "light"`. In most cases, it's not needed.

It uses internally [`useLocalStorage()`](/react-hook/use-local-storage) to persist the value and listens the OS color scheme preferences.
