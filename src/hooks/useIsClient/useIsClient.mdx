This React Hook can be useful in a SSR environment to wait until be in a browser to execution some functions.

Indeed, when the component is mounted in the browser, its state changes and causes a re-render.

Contrarly, if you only want a boolean, without extra render, see [`useSSR()`](/react-hook/use-ssr).
