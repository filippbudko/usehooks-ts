### Introduction

> <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html" target="_blank">Hooks</a> are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

This site presents a collection of hooks for react. Thanks to that, I save time each time I re-use a functionality I already coded, and you too. Nobody wants to re-invent the wheel for each project.

I was strongly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/gragland" target="_blank">useHooks</a>'s <a href="https://usehooks.com/" target="_blank">Gabe Ragland</a>, thanks to him for his work! The idea is not to stupidly copy but to bring a library of hooks written in Typescript, which simplifies my work in a Typescript code base.
